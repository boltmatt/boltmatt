Hi, I’m @boltmatt! Welcome to my GitHub page!

My interests lie in statistical modeling, mostly with a focus on inference and with
applications in the medical field. However, I'm also curious about more "data science-y" methods
and am excited to see where else I can apply statistics!

Currently a Research Instructor at the Center for Innovative Design and Analysis,
Colorado School of Public Health, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus
